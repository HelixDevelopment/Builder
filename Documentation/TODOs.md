# TODOs

- For each category create debate AI group
  - Each coder group shall contain of one coder and one regular model of same model family, for example qwen + qwen-coder
  - Expose the debate group via Ollama for API access

## For later

- Make sure that our scripts present its work like qwen code cli: [https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code)
- Patch Ollama Gemini with changes we want - visual, functional, etc
- Enable Goose worker

## In progress

- Integrate RAG with Fixers to pickup from out memory database
- Fixers: Support for Goose
- Fixers: Auto detection between AI CLIs sorted by priority - claude, goose, qwen, etc
- Web UI for tasks with APIs (instead of manual editing). After we create or edit task submit with confirmation sends it to execution to the AI
- Recipes for adding more tests (each test scenario is defined by the recipe)
