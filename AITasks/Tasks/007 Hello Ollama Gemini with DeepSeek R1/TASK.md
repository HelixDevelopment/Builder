# Hello!

Before you start check all directories under `AITasks/Tasks`. Each directory is one task done by you.
Completed tasks have report markdown file: `TASK_REPORT.md`. Go through each task and its report to learn what you have done so far with the project.
Everything is sorted by number: `001 Description...`, `002 Description`, etc. Also check all relevan markdown file which could be in tasks directories as additions.

After you are done with this, go through all the codebase implementation and define suggestions list on how we could move this project on the next level and how do you see the quality of its implementation.

Once you have extended the project verify that no bugs in the scripts are intorduced and that everything works as expected.
For this task write its `TASK_REPORT.md` so you can continue next time with next / upcoming task. `TASK_REPORT.md` file should go into the directory of this task: `AITasks/007 Hello Ollama Gemini with DeepSeek R1/TASK_REPORT.md`.
All changes and fixes done during the work session have to be documented as the part of the `TASK_REPORT` or in individual markdown file located under the task directory which we are working currentlty.
Put in the report the toal time required you to do the task from the moment I have assigned to you until the total completition. It could be somewhere at the top of the report.
