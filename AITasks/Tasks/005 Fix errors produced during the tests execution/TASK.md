# Fix errors produced during the tests execution

Before you start check all directories under `AITAsks/Tasks`. Each directory is one task done by you.
Completed tasks have report markdown file: `TASK_REPORT.md`. Go through each task and its report to learn what you have done so far with the project.
Everything is sorted by number: `001 Description...`, `002 Description`, etc. Also check all relevan markdown file which could be in tasks directories as additions.

After you are done with this, make sure that all issues are fixed which are produced during running of tests using `test.sh` script with auto fix flag on!
Extend the script to perform proper category models using our `install.sh` script before tests for certain category are performed.

Once you have extended the project verify that no bugs in the scripts are intorduced and that everything works as expected.
For this task write its `TASK_REPORT.md` so you can continue next time with next / upcoming task. `TASK_REPORT.md` file should go into the directory of this task: `AITasks/004 Cover all models by all supported Builder categories/TASK_REPORT.md`.
All changes and fixes done during the work session have to be documented as the part of the `TASK_REPORT` or in individual markdown file located under the task directory which we are working currentlty.
