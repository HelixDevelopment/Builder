   - Added `command-r:35b` (proper 35B model)
   - Kept `aya:35b` (appropriate for 34B category)

4. **Translation/70B**: Added large models:
   - Added `command-r-plus:104b` (moved from 34B)

5. **Generative/PNG/34B**: Fixed oversized model:
   - Removed `qwen2.5-vl:72b` (72B model in 34B category)
   - Model already correctly placed in 70B category

6. **Model Name Corrections**:
   - Fixed `qwen2.5-vl` to `qwen2.5vl` (correct Ollama format)
   - Applied across all PNG and JPEG files

### Verification Completed:
- ✅ All models now correctly sized for their VRAM categories
- ✅ Model names verified against Ollama library
- ✅ Confirmed availability of: llava, qwen2.5vl, gemma2, phi3, command-r, command-r-plus, aya, llama3.2-vision
- ✅ Hugging Face model references maintained with proper `hf.co/` format

### Final Status: FULLY CORRECTED ✅

All model recipes now properly align with VRAM requirements and Ollama availability, ensuring optimal performance across different hardware configurations.
