# Extend Models Recipes

Before you start check all directories under Claude/Tasks. Each directory is one task done by you.
Completed tasks have report markdown file: TASK_REPORT.md. Go through each report to learn what you have done so far with the project.

After you are done with this, make sure that Generative and Localisation models are extended according the markdown (there is PDF as well) documents from the "Claude/Tasks/Extend Models Recipes/Technical Details" directory.

All existing models "recipes" that we are going to be install have to be checked for the availability on Ollama. If there is no particular model we have to pull it from Hugging Face and use it. Hugging Face details are in file: 
"Claude/Tasks/Extend Models Recipes/Technical Details/Sources/Hugging-Face.md" (or its pdf version).

Once you have extended models installation process verify that no bugs in the scripts are intorduced and that everything works as expected.

For this task write its TASK_REPORT.md so you can continue next time with next / upcoming task.
