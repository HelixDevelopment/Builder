# Fill the Models Recipes

I want you to extend existing Models reciped defined under the Scripts/Recipes/Models directory.
All subdirectories are organized hierarchically to represent certain category of models.
Each category has at least 7B file. Some of them have a small lists of models in that file which are going t obe pulled by Ollama.
To understand the use follow everything executed starting the install.sh and later isnatll_ollama_models.sh
You will populate the lists for each category of the models with 7B and other two stronger configurations defined in the scripts.
In the root of each model recipe directory there is a README.md explaining more about the type of the model which are going to be defined. Pay attention that some of them may have subcategories - like for example Generative.
